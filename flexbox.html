          <p>The main idea behind flexbox is flexibility. Flexbox allows us to define flex containers with children
            that can be dynamically sized to fit best within their container. In this page we will introduce you to the
            basic concepts of flexbox and how to get strated with using it!
          </p>

    <main class="main container row">
      <section class="primary-content">
        <h2 class="section-title"><strong>Flexbox basics</strong></h2>
        <p>All we need to start using flexbox is to give a parent element the property of <code>display: flex</code> and
          all its children will become flex items! All items can now be dynamically sized based on the size of their
          container. By default, the flexbox container will align its children elements in a row orientation as can be
          seen below.
        </p>
        <h6 class="example-title"><em>display:flex</em></h6>
        <div class="examples">
          <pre><code>
.flexbox-container {
  display: flex;
}
          </code></pre>
          <div class="flexbox-container">
            <div class="flexbox-child">flexbox-child</div>
            <div class="flexbox-child">flexbox-child</div>
            <div class="flexbox-child">flexbox-child</div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>By comparison, if we were to use default value of <code>display: block</code> the parent container would
          align its children vertically. This effect can be seen below. Note that the shown <code>display: block</code>
          below is not necessary as this is the default behaviour of div elements, I just added it for demonstration
          purposes.
        </p>
        <h6 class="example-title"><em>display:block</em></h6>
        <div class="examples">
          <pre><code>
.block-container {
  display: block;
}
          </code></pre>
          <div class="block-container">
            <div class="block-child">block-child</div>
            <div class="block-child">block-child</div>
            <div class="block-child">block-child</div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>However, the power of flexbox does not become apparent until we start trying to give elements sizes. Let's
          say we wanted to create a row that takes up a 100% of the space available to it, with 3 elements each
          taking up 1/3 of the container. To achieve this, we could do something like the following:
        </p>
        <h6 class="example-title"><em>display:block</em></h6>
        <div class="examples">
          <pre><code>
.block-container {
  display: block;
  width: 100%;
}

.block-child {
  width: 32%;
}
          </code></pre>
          <div class="block-container2">
            <div class="block-child2">block-child</div>
            <div class="block-child2">block-child</div>
            <div class="block-child2">block-child</div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>We use a width of 32% to account for the paddding in the parent element and the borders on the child
          elements. This works ok at larger screen sizes, but at smaller sizes this breaks down because the remaining 4%
          of space available is not sufficient to account for the padding and border, so one of the elements must wrap
          onto a new row, leaving an awful lot of unused space left. You can see this if you resize the browser window
          on which you are viewing this website or by flipping your phone to see the 2 different cases.
        </p>
        <p>Using flexbox, we could achieve this as follows:</p>
        <h6 class="example-title"><em>display:flex</em></h6>
        <div class="examples">
          <pre><code>
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  width: 100%;
}

.flex-child {
  flex: 1 1 33%;
}
          </code></pre>
          <div class="flexbox-container2">
            <div class="flexbox-child2">flexbox-child</div>
            <div class="flexbox-child2">flexbox-child</div>
            <div class="flexbox-child2">flexbox-child</div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>The new property <code>flex: 1 1 auto</code> is a shorthand property that sets 3 different properties at
          once. The first number sets the value of the <code>flex-grow</code> property, this tells a flex child if it is
          allowed to grow past its normal size and by how much. The second number sets the value of the
          <code>flow-shrink</code> property, it works similarly to <code>flex-grow</code> but for shrinking. And finally
          the third value sets the property of <code>flex-basis</code>, which tells the item what its ideal
          size should be. Here, we are telling our items they are allowed to grow and shrink away from their ideal size
          if it is necessary, however they will always try to be their ideal size. Because in our case this size is a
          percentage, our elements will always remain at that ideal size.
        </p>
        <p>This already works a lot better than our
          previous example because flexbox takes into account any border and padding sizes that have been taken up
          already, and distributes the remaining space to its childrend equally. However, we still run into some issues
          when we reduce the size of the browser window to where the child elements can shrink no further without
          overflowing. You can see this if you shrink the browser window yourself. Fortunately, fixing this is really
          easy with flexbox! Here is how to do it:</p>
        <h6 class="example-title"><em>display:flex</em></h6>
        <div class="examples">
          <pre><code>
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  width: 100%;
}
        
.flex-child {
  flex: 1 1 auto;
}
          </code></pre>
          <div class="flexbox-container3">
            <div class="flexbox-child3">flexbox-child</div>
            <div class="flexbox-child3">flexbox-child</div>
            <div class="flexbox-child3">flexbox-child</div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>The above property <code>flex-wrap</code> is a handy little property that allows us to tell our flex
          containers to allow or prevent its child elements from wrapping onto a new row when they are about to
          overflow. Setting it to wrap tells the container to allow its children to wrap instead of overflowing. For it
          to work properly though, we must set <code>flex-basis</code> to a non-numerical value, as flex elements tend
          to prioritize that value over wrapping. We can stilll achieve the desired effect of equally distributing the
          available space amoings the child elements because they all have a property of <code>flex-grow: 1</code> which
          means they will all grow in size equally. Resize the window of your browser to see this effect in practice!
        </p>
        <p>Last, we will achieve the same but using bootstrap's grid system!</p>

        <div class="container margin0">
          <div class="row purple gap0">
            <div class="col">bootstrap grid column</div>
            <div class="col">bootstrap grid column</div>
            <div class="col">bootstrap grid column</div>
          </div>
        </div>
