          <p>Media queries can be useful when trying to apply certain styles depending on the size of the browser window
            or the media type. In this page, we will cover the basics of media queries, as well as give advice on how
            and where to use them!</p>

        <h2 class="section-title"><strong>Media Queries Basics</strong></h2>
        <p>Media queries are composed of any number of media features as well as an optional media type. Media features
          are any features of the current device the page is being viewed on. There is a large list of features that we
          can query for, such as aspect-ratio, any-hover (which tells us if the device supports hovering of any kind),
          orientation (tells us if it is protrait or landscape), and width and height of the viewport. Querying for
          these features can give us a lot of information about the device our website is currently being viewed in,
          and we can make better design choices based on this.
        </p>

        <p>The following example shows how to implement a basic media query that changes the background color of the
          below code block to a light pink at widths of 600px and larger. If you are seeing this page in a page 600px or
          larger you will be treated to a fabulous shade of pink in the below example!</p>

        <pre><code class="size-max-content media">
@media (min-width: 600px) {
  .media {
    background-color: #ffddf4;
  }
}
        </code></pre>

        <p>Media queries can get a lot more specific than this though. We can combine a media feature with a media type
          or another media feature by using the <code>and</code> keyword. We can also have a comma seperated list of
          media queries, which will apply the specified styles when any one of the conditions is being met. Below are
          examples of both:</p>

        <pre><code class="size-max-content">
@media (min-width:30em) and screen { 
  ...
}

@media (min-height: 680px), screen { ... }
        </code></pre>

        <p>A great use of media queries is for creating 'hamburger' or 'three bars' navigation menu for mobile devices.
          Often navigation menus can be too crowded for mobile devices, which can cause them to overflow, cause
          horizontal scrolling to appear, or just squish all the menu items together making them look unprofessional. A
          great solution to this problem is to use a media query to generate a 'hamburger' menu at smaller screen sizes.
          Below is the media query used in this website to detect when we should be applying the 'hamburger' styles:</p>

        <pre><code class="size-max-content">
@media screen and (max-width: 810px) { ... }
        </code></pre>

        <p>If your device in which you are viewing this in is at least 810 pixels wide, you should see a full navigation
          menu. However, if you are below this threshold value, a hamburger menu which can be clicked to be expanded
          should be showing in its stead. Resize your browser window or flip your phone from protrait to landscape if
          you want to see this change take effect!</p>
