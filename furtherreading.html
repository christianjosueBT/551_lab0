        <p>In this website, we barely scratched the surface of what can be done to make websites more responsive and
          accessible! There are a ton of things that we didn't cover, however if this subject has piqued your interest,
          I've compiled a list of resources for learning more about responsive and accessible website design. In the
          table below you will find the best resources I have come across regarding responsive website design!</p>

                  Responsive Layouts 21-day Challenge</a></td>
              <td>In this 21 day challenge, Kevin Powell gives you an overview of how to approach responsive website
                design in short, digestible, little bits. It purposefully takes its time building up small fundamental
                concepts, so that when more difficult ones are introduced you don't find yourself scratching your head.
                It is by no means meant to be a comprehensive resource, however it is a great place to start for
                absoulte beginners as you have to do quite a few challenges, and you get access to a great discord
                channel where you can ask questions to people taking the course at the same time as you. Also, it is
                completely free so that's great! </td>

                and responsive web design is no different. This is the most extensive documentation repository and
                learning resource for open web standards. It is maintained by Mozilla and Google employees and
                volunteers, and in it you can find a plethora of guides, exhaustive documentation of almost anything
                web related, up to date information on things current, deprecated, and experimental web technologies,
                as well as tons of examples and explanations geared towards beginners. By far and away one of the best
                resrouces for learnign about responsive web design and web development overall!</td>

                anyone. They have thousands of hours worth of content, and have helped thousands of people land
                developer jobs. They cover pretty much any area imaginable relating to web development and their
                tutorials and certificates are geared towards being as easy to understand and pain free as possible. It
                is a big time commitment to go through one of their certificates, as they take an estimated 300 hours to
                complete, however I have found their quality to be outstanding so it is well worth it if you have the
                time!</td>
